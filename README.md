## A Beginners Guide to React Introduction

We're using a tool called Browsersync. We're using npx to get that running. npx comes bundled with Node. If you get Node.js installed, then you can use npx. Open the dev tools in your browser to inspect the HTML code. We have two scripts in here that you don't find in the source code. That's added by Browsersync. The cool thing about Browsersync is that you don't have to manually hit the reload button, you just go ahead and change something, hit save and it will automatically reload for you. That's why we're going with Browsersync. It's really nice for this.

## Create a User Interface with Vanilla JavaScript and DOM

### setup/01-document-create-element.html

You can create a simple user interface on the web using HTML and CSS. But as soon as you want to make your application interactive, you need to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to listen to user events and make updates to the user interface. In this lesson we'll learn how to create a <div> element using raw JavaScript and browser APIs.

In review, to create a user interface in JavaScript, you're going to need to have a place where you append your JavaScript-generated DOM elements. We're going to get access to that element from the document APIs. Then we'll create our own element. We'll add some properties onto that element. Then we'll append that element to our rootElement.
