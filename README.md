We're using a tool called Browsersync. We're using npx to get that running. npx comes bundled with Node. If you get Node.js installed, then you can use npx. Open the dev tools in your browser to inspect the HTML code. We have two scripts in here that you don't find in the source code. That's added by Browsersync. The cool thing about Browsersync is that you don't have to manually hit the reload button, you just go ahead and change something, hit save and it will automatically reload for you. That's why we're going with Browsersync. It's really nice for this.
