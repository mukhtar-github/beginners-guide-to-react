## A Beginners Guide to React Introduction

### final/01-document-create-element.html

We're using a tool called Browsersync. We're using npx to get that running. npx comes bundled with Node. If you get Node.js installed, then you can use npx. Open the dev tools in your browser to inspect the HTML code. We have two scripts in here that you don't find in the source code. That's added by Browsersync. The cool thing about Browsersync is that you don't have to manually hit the reload button, you just go ahead and change something, hit save and it will automatically reload for you. That's why we're going with Browsersync. It's really nice for this.

## Create a User Interface with Vanilla JavaScript and DOM

### setup/01-document-create-element.html

You can create a simple user interface on the web using HTML and CSS. But as soon as you want to make your application interactive, you need to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to listen to user events and make updates to the user interface. In this lesson we'll learn how to create a 'div' element using raw JavaScript and browser APIs.

In review, to create a user interface in JavaScript, you're going to need to have a place where you append your JavaScript-generated DOM elements. We're going to get access to that element from the document APIs. Then we'll create our own element. We'll add some properties onto that element. Then we'll append that element to our rootElement.

## Create a User Interface with React’s createElement API

### setup/02-react-create-element.html

React uses the same APIs to control and update the DOM that we did in the previous lesson. But it offers so much to the table that we’re going to introduce it into the project and rewrite what we’ve written to React code. Instead of creating DOM elements, we’ll create React elements and then hand those off to react-dom to handle turning those into DOM elements and putting them into the page.

If you’ve ever learned or used React before, you’re probably more familiar with JSX than React’s createElement API, but it’s important to understand the createElement API first so you understand the magic and can become a code magician yourself. Not to worry, we’ll get to JSX soon enough!

To use React to create this user interface, we're going to need to have React on the page. We can get React from npm, but there's a service called unpackage that we're going to use. If I go to unpackage.com that will show me how to use unpackage to get any file that is distributed on npm. It has these files for React. If I go to that file, then I'll see a minified version of React.

With React and ReactDOM both on the page, I can now create React elements and then use ReactDOM to render those elements to the page. The API is not exactly the same as the one that we get with document. We do get to specify the type of element as the first argument, but instead of getting the element and attaching properties to it, we specify those properties on creation as an object.
